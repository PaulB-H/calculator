<h4>Tech</h4>
<p>HTML, CSS, JS</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

- One of the earliest practices we did when I started learning
coding was building a calculator, and I wanted to give it a shot
from scratch now that I have learnt more.
<br />
- Tried to limit possible errors by preventing things like trailing
operators, and prefixed 0's which caused the eval() function to
break.
