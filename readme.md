<h3 class="projectHeader">Calculator</h3>

<p class="projectDesc">
  One of the first JavaScript projects we made when I started learning
  coding was building a calculator, I wanted to repeat this from
  scratch with what I have learned since.
</p>

<p class="projectDesc">
  I had tried a few times before, but after having spent so much time
  on code challenges and working with vanilla JS and the DOM, I was a
  lot more confident this attempt. I tried to limit possible errors by
  preventing things like trailing operators, and prefixed 0's which
  caused the eval() function to break.
